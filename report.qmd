## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the differences in electric vehicle (EV) adoption between selected Asian (China, India, Japan) and European (Norway, Finland, Austria) countries from 2013 to 2023. Using data from Our World in Data and the IMPACT Cycle framework, we found that European countries experienced a sharp rise in EV market share, driven by strong policy support such as high taxes on petrol cars and generous EV incentives. In contrast, Asian countries showed slower growth, largely due to weaker government supportâ€”except for China, which demonstrated rapid adoption. These findings highlight the critical role of national policy in shaping the trajectory of EV usage.

## Introduction

The global transition toward electric vehicles (EVs) has gained momentum over the past decade, yet significant differences in adoption rates exist between regions. This study investigates how EV sales shares have evolved in selected Asian (China, India, Japan) and European (Norway, Finland, Austria) countries between 2013 and 2023. By analyzing public data from Our World in Data and applying the IMPACT Cycle methodology, we aim to uncover the underlying factors behind these regional disparities. Initial observations suggest that European nations have experienced a rapid increase in EV adoption, whereas most Asian countries have progressed more gradually. These trends raise important questions about the role of government policies, infrastructure, and public awareness in accelerating EV uptake. China, however, emerges as an exception within Asia, showing growth patterns similar to European counterparts. The analysis focuses on identifying such key differences and understanding their root causes. This comparison provides insight into how policy environments influence consumer behavior and technological adoption. Through this research, we aim to offer actionable recommendations for countries lagging in EV adoption. The goal is to inform strategies that support a more balanced and equitable global shift toward electric mobility.
