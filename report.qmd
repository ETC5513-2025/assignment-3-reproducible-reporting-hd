## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the differences in electric vehicle (EV) adoption between selected Asian (China, India, Japan) and European (Norway, Finland, Austria) countries from 2013 to 2023. Using data from Our World in Data and the IMPACT Cycle framework, we found that European countries experienced a sharp rise in EV market share, driven by strong policy support such as high taxes on petrol cars and generous EV incentives. In contrast, Asian countries showed slower growth, largely due to weaker government support—except for China, which demonstrated rapid adoption. These findings highlight the critical role of national policy in shaping the trajectory of EV usage.

## Introduction

The global transition toward electric vehicles (EVs) has gained momentum over the past decade, yet significant differences in adoption rates exist between regions. This study investigates how EV sales shares have evolved in selected Asian (China, India, Japan) and European (Norway, Finland, Austria) countries between 2013 and 2023. By analyzing public data from Our World in Data and applying the IMPACT Cycle methodology, we aim to uncover the underlying factors behind these regional disparities. Initial observations suggest that European nations have experienced a rapid increase in EV adoption, whereas most Asian countries have progressed more gradually. These trends raise important questions about the role of government policies, infrastructure, and public awareness in accelerating EV uptake. China, however, emerges as an exception within Asia, showing growth patterns similar to European counterparts. The analysis focuses on identifying such key differences and understanding their root causes. This comparison provides insight into how policy environments influence consumer behavior and technological adoption. Through this research, we aim to offer actionable recommendations for countries lagging in EV adoption. The goal is to inform strategies that support a more balanced and equitable global shift toward electric mobility.


## Discussion
The analysis reveals significant regional disparities in electric vehicle (EV) adoption between selected Asian and European countries from 2013 to 2023. European nations such as Norway and Finland achieved high EV market shares, largely due to robust government policies—including early purchase subsidies, high fuel taxes, and substantial investment in EV infrastructure. In contrast, most Asian countries, with the notable exception of China, experienced much slower adoption, which can be attributed to weaker institutional support and limited public infrastructure. China stands out within the Asian group, having demonstrated rapid EV growth patterns similar to its European counterparts. This suggests that strong and sustained government intervention—such as preferential tax exemptions and strategic planning—can effectively overcome structural constraints (State Council of the People’s Republic of China, 2023).

## Conclusion
These findings reinforce the critical role of national policy frameworks, financial incentives, and public infrastructure in shaping EV adoption trajectories. Although cultural and economic contexts differ across regions, the data-driven patterns observed through the IMPACT Cycle framework highlight that consistent, policy-led strategies have produced measurable growth in EV market share. The contrasting trajectories between countries underscore how deliberate policy choices can accelerate or hinder the transition to electric mobility.

## Recommendations
To encourage broader adoption, countries with low EV uptake—such as India and Japan—should consider adopting proven policy mechanisms implemented in Europe and China. These include offering generous purchase subsidies, implementing tax penalties on internal combustion engine vehicles, expanding charging infrastructure, and increasing public awareness through coordinated campaigns (Green eMotion, 2015). Setting clear national targets for EV adoption can also help guide private sector investments and align consumer expectations. A comprehensive, multi-pronged approach—consistent with the “Track Outcomes” and “Communicate Insights” phases of the IMPACT Cycle—will be essential in fostering a more equitable and sustainable global shift toward electric transportation.
