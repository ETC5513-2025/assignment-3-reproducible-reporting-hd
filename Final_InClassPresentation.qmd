## Problem Introduction

- Global EV adoption has increased, but uptake varies significantly between regions.
- This study compares EV sales shares from **2013–2023** in:
  - **Asia**: China, India, Japan  
  - **Europe**: Norway, Finland, Austria
  
- The research question:  
  *How have electric vehicle shares evolved between 2013 and 2023 across selected Asian and European countries, and what regional differences can be observed?*
- The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to support more balanced EV growth.


## Dataset Description
```{r}
# Data prep
original_df <- read_csv("Data/electric-car-sales-share/electric-car-sales-share.csv")

countries <- selected_countries <- c("China", "India", 
                                     "Japan", "Austria", 
                                     "Finland", "Norway")

cleaned_df <- original_df %>%
  rename(Country = Entity,
         Electric_Car_Share = `Share of new cars that are electric`) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2013, Year <= 2023, 
         Country %in% countries) %>%
  drop_na()
```

- The dataset covers EV share in new car sales from **2005 to 2023** across **100+ countries**.
- The dataset was retrieved from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/electric-car-sales-share), based on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

- This report focuses on **China, India, Japan, Austria, Finland, and Norway** between **2013–2023**  
  to compare trends in **Asia vs. Europe**, based on market size and EV adoption progress.
- The final dataset contains **`r nrow(cleaned_df)` rows** and **`r ncol(cleaned_df)` columns**
- Includes:
  - **2 character variables**: `Country`, `Code`
  - **2 numeric variables**: `Year`, `Electric_Car_Share`

```{r}

# Preparation for data descriptions table
data_description <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Country", "Code", "Year", "Electric_Car_Share"),
  Description = c(
    "Name of the country where the data was collected",
    "ISO 3-letter country code",
    "Year of observation (from 2013 to 2023)",
    "Percentage of electric vehicles in new car sales"
  ))
```

## Data Dictionary

The description of each variable is shown in @tbl-DataDict.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-DataDict
#| tbl-cap: "Data dictionary for electric car sales share dataset"

data_description %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped",
                                      "hover",
                                      "condensed",
                                      "responsive",
                                      "bordered"),
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "center")
```
 
## Methods

We used the **IMPACT Cycle** to structure our analysis. This framework supports data-driven problem-solving from question formulation to action.

- **I – Identify**:  
  Formulated the research question – how has EV adoption evolved between 2013–2023 across selected Asian and European countries?

- **M – Master the Data**:  
  Cleaned and filtered EV share data.

- **P – Perform Analysis**:  
  Visualised trends in EV adoption and compared growth across regions using R.

- **A – Address and Refine Results**:  
  Interpreted results to highlight regional insights and possible influencing factors.

- **C – Communicate**:  
  Developed slides and written report to present findings clearly.

- **T – Track Outcomes**:  
  Proposed recommendations to encourage EV adoption, especially in lower-performing countries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EV Trend by Region (2013–2023)

- Norway leads with over 80% EV share in 2023.  

- China surged post-2016.  

- Japan and India stayed below 2%.

```{r}
# Separate countries into two regions
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>%
  mutate(Region = if_else(Country %in% c("Norway", "Finland", "Austria"), 
                          "Europe", "Asia"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-ev-faceted
#| fig-cap: "EV sales share trends in selected Asian and European countries from 2013 to 2023."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(cleaned_df, aes(x = Year, y = Electric_Car_Share, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2013:2023) +
  facet_wrap(~Region) +
  labs(title = "Electric Vehicle Sales Share (2013–2023)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "EV Share (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```



------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Average EV Share by Country (2013–2023)

- Norway has the highest average (>50%)  
- Finland and China follow, showing good progress  
- Austria is mid-range  
- Japan and India remain low (<2%)

```{r}
# Calculate the average EV share for each country from 2013 to 2023
avg_ev_df <- cleaned_df %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Average_EV_Share = mean(Electric_Car_Share, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-ev-average-bar
#| fig-cap: "Average EV sales share in each country from 2013 to 2023."
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center

avg_ev_df <- cleaned_df %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Average_EV_Share = mean(Electric_Car_Share, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(avg_ev_df, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Average_EV_Share), 
                      y = Average_EV_Share, fill = Country)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Average Electric Vehicle Share by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Average EV Share (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Policy-Driven Differences in EV Adoption {.slide background-image="Images/2.png" background-size="contain" background-position="center" background-opacity="0.15"}

- **Europe (e.g., Norway, Finland)**  
  → Strong government incentives, charging infrastructure, etc 
  → High EV market share (>80% in Norway by 2023)  

- **China**  
  → National policy support, tax exemption programs  
  → Fast growth since 2016, reached 35% in 2023  

- **India & Japan**  
  → Weak EV policies, low consumer incentives  
  → EV share stayed under 2% throughout the period  

- <span style="color: red;"><strong>Insight</strong>:</span> Policy strength is a key driver of EV adoption.
